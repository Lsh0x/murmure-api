# Murmure

A privacy-first, open-source speech-to-text application that runs entirely on your machine, powered by a neural network via NVIDIA's Parakeet model for fast, local transcription. Murmure turns your voice into text with no internet connection and zero data collection, and supports 25 European languages.

Learn more on the on the [official website](https://murmure.al1x-ai.com/).

> **Note**: This repository contains both the original Murmure desktop application and a standalone gRPC server implementation. The gRPC server allows you to run Murmure as a service that can be deployed locally or in the cloud (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.). For the original desktop application, see the [official Murmure repository](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure).

## Supported Languages:

Bulgarian (bg), Croatian (hr), Czech (cs), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English (en), Estonian (et), Finnish (fi), French (fr), German (de), Greek (el), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Latvian (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Maltese (mt), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Romanian (ro), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es), Swedish (sv), Russian (ru), Ukrainian (uk)

## Installation

### Windows (Official)

⚠️ Windows SmartScreen : This installer is **not signed with a commercial certificate** (which costs ~€200–€500/year).  
If you downloaded it from our **official GitHub releases**, you can safely continue.

🛡️ We guarantee the installer is safe, contains **no malware**, and you can verify the source code or even compile it yourself if you prefer.

1. Download murmure_{version}_x64_en-US.msi from the [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.

### Linux (Official)

⚠️ Murmure doesn’t work well on Wayland-based distributions (except Fedora, which has no issues). It seems to be a problem related to the Tauri framework I used, and being on X11 doesn’t make it easy for me to fix the issue.

1. Download murmure_{version}_amd64.AppImage from [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x murmure-x86_64.AppImage`
3. Run the AppImage.

Murmure uses the [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page) API to
access your microphone, so if you're running Pipewire for your audio stack,
make sure that the ALSA API calls are routed through it (e.g. by installing
[the `pipewire-alsa`
package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pipewire-alsa/) on Arch
Linux), otherwise you'll have errors such as `ALSA lib
pcm_dsnoop.c:567:(snd_pcm_dsnoop_open) unable to open slave`.

#### Arch Linux (Community)

⚠️ Community builds are maintained by kind contributors on a best-effort basis.
They do their best to keep them up to date, but there’s no guarantee they will always be.
If you encounter a bug with one of these packages, please open an issue in the corresponding community repository instead.

Community repository: https://github.com/Horgix/aur-package_murmure_mirror

On Arch Linux, you can install [the `murmure` package directly from the
AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/murmure) using your favorite helper:

```sh
aura -A murmure
# Or
yay -S murmure
# Or
paru -S murmure
```

## Usage

Murmure provides a clean and focused speech-to-text experience.
Once launched, simply start recording your voice. The text appears instantly, processed directly on your computer.

Typical use cases include:

- Dictating to any AI prompt (Cursor, ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.)
- Writing notes hands-free
- Capturing creative ideas or dictation

Because all computation is local, no network connection is required.

## Technology

Murmure uses NVIDIA’s Parakeet TDT, a highly optimized, experimental transformer-based speech recognition model designed for low-latency, on-device inference. It combines fast transcription with strong accuracy across multiple languages, running efficiently on consumer GPUs or CPUs.
